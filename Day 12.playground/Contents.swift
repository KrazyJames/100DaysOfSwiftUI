// Classes are pretty similar to structs, they are created similar and keep properties and methods
// Classes introduce a new, important, and complex feature called inheritance, which is the ability to make one class build on the foundations of another.

// MARK: - How to copy classes

// All capies of a class always point to a single data source, thats why their are 'reference type' while structs are 'value type' because you copy the actual object in another real copy

// MARK: - How to create a deinitializer for a class

// Unlike structs, classes support optionally a deinit function, which takes no parameter, cannot be called and it's triggered by the system as needed (when the final copy that points to it, is removed).

class Student {
    let id: Int
    
    init(id: Int) {
        self.id = id
        print("Student \(id) is alive")

// MARK: - Summary: Classes

/*
 CLASSES have lots of things in COMMON with STRUCTS, including the ability to have PROPERTIES and METHODS, but there are five key differences between classes and structs.
 - First, classes can INHERIT from other classes, which means they get access to the properties and methods of their PARENT class. You can optionally OVERRIDE methods in child classes if you want, or mark a class as being FINAL to stop others subclassing it.
 - Second, Swift DOESN'T generate a MEMBERWHISE INIT for classes, so you need to do it yourself. If a subclass has its own initializer, it must always call the PARENT classâ€™s INIT at some point.
 - Third, if you create a class instance then take copies of it, all those copies point back to the SAME instance. This means changing some data in one of the copies changes them ALL.
 - Fourth, classes can have DEINITs that run when the LAST COPY of one instance is DESTROYED.
 - Finally, variable properties inside class instances can be CHANGED regardless of whether the instance itself was created as variable or constant.

// MARK: - Checkpoint 7

/*
 Your challenge is this: make a class hierarchy for animals, starting with Animal at the top, then Dog and Cat as subclasses, then Corgi and Poodle as subclasses of Dog, and Persian and Lion as subclasses of Cat.
 
 - The Animal class should have a legs integer property that tracks how many legs the animal has.
 - The Dog class should have a speak() method that prints a generic dog barking string, but each of the subclasses should print something slightly different.
 - The Cat class should have a matching speak() method, again with each subclass printing something different.
 - The Cat class should have an isTame Boolean property, provided using an initializer.
